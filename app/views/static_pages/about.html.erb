    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600">
      MyMTL is a movie tier list website that was born out of a passion for movies rankings,
      and a desire to create a more engaging and visually appealing way to maintain them.
      The idea for the MyMTL was conceived after realizing the limitations of the google
      doc-based movie ranking system used by my gaming communityâ€™s movie night.
      With MyMTL I aimed to create an interactive platform that would allow the members
      of my community to easily curate and share their own personalized movie rankings.
